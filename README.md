To test the application and server:

Install dependencies in server folder. "npm install"
Install dependencies in client-side folder. "npm install"
The mongoDB database credentials are already included in the .env file of server.

After installing the dependencies,
Start the server by running "npm start" inside server folder.
Start the client-side applicatin by running "npm start" inside client-side folder.

To test the chat app, open two client apps, with each from a different browser, e.g. one is Chrome and the other is Microsoft Edge. 
Compare and observe that the two app's messages are sent and received in real-time.
